## Raincloud Plot Visualization

### Introduction
- Raincloud plots are a combination of a violin plot, a box plot, and a scatter plot
- They provide a comprehensive view of the data distribution, showing the density, range, and individual data points
- The original paper, titled "Raincloud plots: a multi-platform tool for robust data visualization," published in January 2019 at [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6480976/), has garnered 1,390 citations as of today (November 8, 2024)

### Installation
```bash
pip install uv
uv pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn # Accelerate BLAST performance by using `uv` to install and manage a virtual environment.
```

### Data
I use the Iris dataset to demonstrate the raincloud plot


### The benefits of using a raincloud plot include:
- 1 Provides more information about the data compared to a traditional boxplot
- 2 Allows for the comparison of multiple distributions within the same plot
- 3 Easier to interpret than a traditional boxplot

### Brief conclusion: 
- **Efficiency**: RainCloud plots offer a more concise and informative way to visualize data, potentially reducing the need for extensive ink and paper usage
- **Implementation**: The code for RainCloud plots is relatively easy to implement and customize, with minimal dependencies
